# Arc Raiders Companion App Development Log

## Overview
This project aims to create a companion application for the game *Arc Raiders*. The app will provide users with resources, tracking, and guides. The project structure is organized to include the application source code, planning documents, and documentation.

## Architectural Decisions
- **Project Structure**:
  - `/app`: Contains the source code for the application (Tech stack TBD).
  - `/planning`: Stores project management documents, roadmaps, and design specs.
  - `/docs`: Contains user and developer documentation.
  - Root level includes `README.md` and `FYI.md` for high-level info.

## Technical Decisions
- **Version Control**: GitHub repository `Arc-Raiders-Companion`.
- **Development Framework**: (To be determined - likely React Native/Expo for cross-platform compatibility on WSL/Windows/iOS).

## Error Log
- (No errors yet)

## Development Log
- **2025-11-24**: Initialized Git repository, created project structure (app, docs, planning), and pushed to GitHub (https://github.com/RichelynScott/Arc-Raiders-Companion).

## Future Improvements
- **CI/CD**: Implement GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- **Tech Stack Selection**: Finalize the decision between Native iOS (requires Mac) or Cross-platform (React Native/Flutter).
